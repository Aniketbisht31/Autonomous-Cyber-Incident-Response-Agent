# Autonomous-Cyber-Incident-Response-Agent
Modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by large volumes of alerts generated from SIEM and endpoint monitoring tools, leading to delayed incident response and analyst fatigue. This project introduces an autonomous AI-driven incident response agent designed to analyze, correlate, and prioritize security events across distributed infrastructure.

By leveraging multi-agent orchestration and behavioral anomaly detection, the system automates threat investigation and generates structured response playbooks. The solution operates entirely using locally hosted LLMs, ensuring sensitive security data never leaves the environment.

This project demonstrates the potential of Agentic AI in cybersecurity by reducing response times, improving threat visibility, and enabling scalable, intelligent security automation.
